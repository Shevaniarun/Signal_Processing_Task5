# Signal_Processing_Task5
The python files of the preprocessing, extract features, and plot has been extracted from the rar file.
The functions like remove_outliers,remove_ectopic_beats,is_outlier,_remove_outlier_karlsson,_remove_outlier_acar,interpolate_nan_values,get_nn_intervals,is_valid_sample has been called from the preprocessing script to the main script.
The functions like get_time_domain_features, get_geometrical_features, get_frequency_domain_features, _get_freq_psd_from_nn_intervals, _create_time_info, _create_interpolation_time, _get_features_from_psd, get_csi_cvi_features, get_poincare_plot_features, DFA, get_sampen has been called from the extract features script to the main script.
The respective values has been plotted with plot python script.
